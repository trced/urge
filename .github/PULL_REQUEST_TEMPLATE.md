# What this changes

<!--
One or two sentences. The diff says what; say why.

## Reasoning

<!--
What alternative did you reject, and why? What would a reviewer not guess from reading the diff? Leave this out only for a one-line typo fix.
-->

## Screenshots

<!--
Required for any visible change. Before and after, at phone width and at desktop width — the layout switches from one column to two panels at 900 px, and the two sides break independently. Delete this section for changes with no visible effect.

## Checks

- [ ] `npm run build` passes (it runs the typecheck too)
- [ ] `npm test` passes
- [ ] Tests added or updated — a bug fix has a test that failed before it
- [ ] No hard-coded colour, size, spacing or duration; tokens only
- [ ] No hover, focus or active state changes the geometry of anything
- [ ] Touch targets stay at 44 × 44, focus stays visible
- [ ] New strings exist in both `src/i18n/fr.ts` and `src/i18n/en.ts`
- [ ] Changelog entry proposed in the description, if a user would notice (`CHANGELOG.md` and `src/data/changelog/` are written at release time)
- [ ] Checked at phone and desktop widths, in light and dark
